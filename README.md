# House Median Value Prediction Investigation

An investigation into building a prediction model for the Boston Housing
dataset. This investigation was based on [this
dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) and
guided by [this previous
analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset/notebook)
(with me trying different models and parameters and eventually getting
different results). Each section contains insight into my personal
understanding of the analysis and how I reached the final outcome.
